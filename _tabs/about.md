I’m Jamai Badr Eddine, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for securing digital environments. In October 2023, I earned my Master’s degree in Information Systems Security (ISS) from the National School of Applied Sciences (ENSA) in Kenitra. That same month, I began my professional journey as a Pentester and Red Teamer, helping enterprises strengthen their security posture.  

I’m particularly fascinated by Active Directory and malware development, and I’m constantly exploring new ways to tackle cybersecurity challenges. This blog is my way of sharing insights, tips, and advice about cybersecurity with you. Whether you’re a fellow professional, a student, or just curious about the field, I hope you find value in the content I create.  

If you have any suggestions, questions, or collaboration ideas, feel free to reach out to me through my social media accounts.
